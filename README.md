\# Task 1: Simple Multi-Agent Simulation



\## Description

This task demonstrates a simple multi-agent simulation using Python.

One agent collects company-related data, and another agent analyzes the data

to produce a final insight.



\## Agents Used

1\. Data Collector Agent – Gathers basic company information.

2\. Analyst Agent – Analyzes the collected data and provides insights.



\## Workflow

\- The Data Collector agent collects information about a company.

\- The Analyst agent evaluates the collected data.

\- The Orchestrator coordinates both agents and prints the final result.



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Multi-agent logic (GenAI concept)



\## How to Run

1\. Open terminal / PowerShell

2\. Navigate to the project folder

3\. Run:

&nbsp;  python task1\_multi\_agent.py



\## Output

The program prints collected data and final analysis for the given company.
